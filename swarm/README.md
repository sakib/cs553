Vote on Docker
==============

Getting started
---------------

The app will be running at [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000), and the results will be at [http://localhost:5001](http://localhost:5001).

Run app on a [Docker Swarm](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/), first make sure you have a swarm. If you don't, run:
```
docker swarm init
```
Once you have your swarm, in this directory run:
```
docker stack deploy -c docker-stack.yml voteswarm
```

To update any part of the app, edit the docker-stack.yml file and run deploy again.
